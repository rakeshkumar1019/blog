#Redux
## Three Core Principle
1. The Global state of your application is stored as an object inside  a single store.
2. The only way to change the state is to dispatch an action, an object that describes what happened.
3. To specify how the state tree is updated based on action, You write pure reducers.
```
const reducer  = (state= initalState, action) =>{
    switch(action.type){
        case CAKE_ORDERED:
        return{
            numOfCakes: state.numOfCakes - 1;
        }
    }
}
```

## Redux store
- one store for the entire application
> Responsibilities: 
- Holds application state
- Allow access to state via `getState()`
- Allow state to be updated via `dispatch(action)`
- Register listeners via subscribe(listener)
- Handles unregistering of listeners via the function returned by subscribe(listener)

## Code Example
```
const redux = require('redux')
const createStore = redux.createStore

const CAKE_ORDERED = 'CAKE_ORDERED';

function orderCake(){
    return{
        type: CAKE_ORDERED,
        quantity: 1,
    }
}
const  initialState = {
    numOfCakes: 10,
    anotherProperty: 0,
}

const reducer = (state = initialState, action) =>{
    switch(action.type){
        case CAKE_ORDERED:
            return{
                ...state,
                numOfCakes: state.numOfCakes - 1,
            }
        default:
            return state;
    }
}

const store = createStore(reducer)
console.log("InitalState",store.getState())
const unsubscribe =  store.subscribe(()=> console.log("update state", store.getState()))
store.dispatch(orderCake())
store.dispatch(orderCake())
store.dispatch(orderCake())

unsubscribe();
store.dispatch(orderCake())

```
